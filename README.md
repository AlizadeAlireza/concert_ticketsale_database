# concert_ticketsale_database
this is a concert ticket sale database that create it for my database lab.


# Introduction

This system is designed to sell concert tickets
After creating a user profile,
the user has the ability to log in and is allowed to perform activities such as buying tickets and viewing the information of concerts and bands available, as well as the venue and capacity, etc.
Our main focus in this environment is on the concert, which is our main nature, and what concert the ticket we buy is related to and by whom.
Also, all tickets have a price group.

# System Features
  -  Ordering tickets by the user for the desired number (available number), which can be identified and tracked by a unique identifier.
